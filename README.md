# Calendar-UI
This project demonstrates the design process from user data all the way to a working prototype. For this project, the goal is to create a prototype that improves user experience when create a calendar. Below are the various steps with images and short descriptions to highlight the most imporant takeaways. 
## Step 1: Gathering Data

* After Conducting Contextual inquiry interviews to gather user data, I constructed data models to organize and pinpoint the key aspects for my design. 
## Step 2: Creating low-fidelity prototypes

* After gathering and analyzing user data, I created low-fidelity prototypes to have the blueprint/foundation for my final design. These prototypes simplify the process of creating a final prototype as they provide an effective outline to follow. 
## Step 3: Creating a High-fidelity prototype

* After creating low-fidelity prototypes, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma to have an interactive UI that demonstrates user interaction with the final design. 
This prototype is not the final product and is still currently being worked on.
