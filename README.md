# Calendar-UI
This project demonstrates the design process from user data all the way to a working prototype. For this project, the goal is to create a prototype that improves user experience when create a calendar. Below are the various steps with images and short descriptions to highlight the most imporant takeaways. I worked with two other group members, Trenton Klasell and Braden Hicks.
## Step 1: Gathering Data

* After Conducting Contextual inquiry interviews to gather user data, we constructed data models to organize and pinpoint the key aspects for my design. 
## Step 2: Creating low-fidelity prototypes

* After gathering and analyzing user data, we created low-fidelity prototypes to have the blueprint/foundation for our final design. These prototypes simplify the process of creating a final prototype as they provide an effective outline to follow. 
## Step 3: Creating a High-fidelity prototype

* After creating low-fidelity prototypes, we created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma to have an interactive UI that demonstrates user interaction with the final design. 
This prototype is not the final product, I am personally continuing with the project. 
## Step 4: Creating final product 

*Using the high-fidelity prototype, I transitioned the figma project into a web application utilizing HTML/CSS/JS. I have individually worked on this project and will continue to implement and commit changes. The files and commits can be seen above.
