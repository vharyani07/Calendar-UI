## 🚨 Node.js Required

To use React, we need **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

3. Choose the **Windows Installer (.msi)** - 64-bit

### Step 2: Install Node.js

1. Run the downloaded `.msi` file
2. Click **Next** through the installer
3. **Important**: Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked ✅
4. Accept the license agreement
5. Click **Install**
6. Wait for installation to complete
7. Click **Finish**

### Step 3: Verify Installation

After installation, **close and reopen** your terminal/PowerShell, then run:

## ✅ Once Installed

Let me know when Node.js is installed, and I'll:

4. Start the development server

## 💡 Alternative: Use Online IDE

If you prefer not to install Node.js right now, we could:
- Use **StackBlitz** (online React IDE)
- Use **CodeSandbox** (browser-based development)

Let me know your preference!
